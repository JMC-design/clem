    <h1> Cyrus Harmon's Lisp Matrix Package </h1>
    
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    
    <p>
      I'm sure this has been a written a thousand times before, but,
      partially because I need such a thing and partially as an
      exercise in both LISP programming and matrix operations, I have
      written a common-lisp package for matrix operations
    </p>

    <p>
      The package consists of common-lisp classes, methods and
      functions for creating and operating on matrices. The package is
      called "matrix" and the core class is "matrix". Perhaps I should
      use a less generic name. Let me know if the name causes
      problems.
    </p>
