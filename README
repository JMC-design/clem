TODO:

1. Need a better mechanism for creating, populating, copying and
converting to and from matrices of a given type. How to create
matrices of the following types:

double-float
single-float
unsigned-byte
signed-byte
unsigned-word
signed-word
bit (or whatever the appropriate one bit type is)

* Need to set/get values from a given matrix type appropriately

* scalar-ops should work between matrices of different types

* Need to be able to convert from one matrix type to another

* random-matrix should work

* need functions to create a matrix of the same type, and of the same
type and dimensions.

2. shared-initialize

Ok, so being new to CL, I didn't know about shared-initialize (and
initialize-instance and re-initialize-instance) so I didn't know how
to get slots initialized via make-instance. Now I now all this so I
need to remove the hacked up constructor functions I made and replace
everything with calls to make-instance.
