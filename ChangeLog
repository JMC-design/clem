2005-07-22  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-transform.cl:
	fixed the type of zero. I was declaring zero as the type of the coord,
	not of the value at the coord. this was compiling (safety 0) but
	causing the background to be hosed. whoops!

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-move.cl:
	removed unused third argument of frobs
	added more bit-matrix move types

	* src/transform.cl: :x and :y become :x-shift and :y-shift

	  args come in from instances of the metaclass
	filling val-format from ancestor, for what that's worth

	added print-object method for matrices so we don't have to rely on
	matrix-print anymore

2005-07-15  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* test/test-convolve.cl:
	fixing test to work with new separable-discrete-convolve

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-convolve.cl:
	separable-discrete-convolve now works better

	* src/matrixops.cl:
	added gaussian-kernel-1d (should really take dim args for the 2d
	version)
	messing with separable-discrete-convolve and gaussian-blur

	* src/matrix.cl:
	added sum-cols and sum-rows. I feel like I did this before, but i
	couldnt' find it. Note that these are untyped. Adding typed versions
	is trivial.

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-convolve.cl:
	ok, separable-discrete-convolve is in better shape now...

2005-07-14  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/row-vector.cl, src/col-vector.cl:
	allocate-matrix-vals now matches what matrix uses. this shoud probably go away, however.

	* clem.asd: added a depends on ch-util

	* test/test-convolve.cl, src/typed-ops/defmatrix-sum.cl, src/typed-ops/defmatrix-move-add-subtr.cl, src/matrixops.cl, doc/index.html:

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-convolve.cl: adding typed convolve functions

2005-07-13  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/transform.cl: timestamps are a bad idea in source files

	* src/interpolation.cl: time stamps are a bad idea in source files

	* src/defpackage.cl:
	export the following symbols: mat-copy-proto, affine-transformation,
	transform-matrix, matrix-move.

	* src/interpolation.cl:
	added a once-only macro around the bilinear-interp macro. I should
	probably do the same for the quadratic one.

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-transform.cl:
	using types for quadratic interp macros now

	* src/interpolation.cl:
	had to add a type argument to quadratic-kernel and quadratic
	interpolate to make SBCLs compiler happy.

	* clem.asd: added interpolation file to asd

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-transform.cl:
	added quadratic interpolation. not sure that these work with types
	other than double-float, however.

	* src/interpolation.cl: ... moved interpolation functions here.
	... added bilinear and quadratic interpolation routines.  note, these just
	interpolate the values, to actually interprolate the values in a
	matrix, say via an affine tranformation, see transform.cl

2005-07-12  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-transform.cl: restore all of the frobs

	* src/transform.cl:
	make a subclass of double-float-matrix to hold the affine
	transformation parameters. appropriate changes to make this work
	properly.

	* src/matrix.cl:
	added rvref and cvref for row-vector and column-vector refs.

	* src/defmatrix.cl: removed defmatrix-method

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-transform.cl:
	made %transform-matrix a lot faster by avoiding a full matrix-multiply
	using foley et al.'s trick that exploits the structure of the affine
	transformation matrix.

2005-07-10  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-move-add-subtr.cl:
	added more move/add/subtr types

2005-07-08  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/typed-ops/defmatrix-transform.cl, clem.asd:
	added defmatrix-transform which defines optimized transform-matrix functions

	made mat-mult3 non-consing

	* src/matrix.cl:
	rows and cols now use array-dimension instead of array-dimensions
	which is non-consing.

	* src/matrix.cl:
	array->matrix goes straight to matrix, not to row-vector, col-vector or scalar

2005-07-06  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* test/test-clem.cl, clem.asd, clem-test.asd: removing registry stuff
	fixing a type (ch-uti -> ch-util)

2005-07-01  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* Makefile, src/.cvsignore, src/typed-ops/.cvsignore, test/.cvsignore:

	* added test-hprod file and to clem-test.asd
	* added defmatrix-mult file and to clem.asd
	* map-matrix-copy now accepts a matrix-class argument and calls

2005-06-15  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* test/test-clem2.cl:
	fixed single-float literal vals (were erroneous doubles)

	* src/defmatrix.cl: whoops. left some debug statements in here...

	* src/defmatrix-hprod.cl, src/defmatrix-move-add-subtr.cl, src/defmatrix-scale.cl:
	moved these files to typed-ops

	* test/test-clem2.cl, src/typed-ops/defmatrix-hprod.cl, src/defmatrix.cl, clem.asd, LICENSE, ChangeLog:
	moved some typed matrix operations into their own directory

	* The big unsigned-byte -> ub8 and friends rename.
	  ... Now use ub32-matrix instead of unsigned-long matrix.
	      Some folks might hate the numbers, but word and long were
	      just too vague and all of those unsigned ints are in fact
	      bytes to lisp anyway!

2005-06-14  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* test/test-clem3.cl: making function names agree
	removing erroneous compiler output that popped in here somehow

	* src/defmatrix-types.cl, src/defmatrix-move-add-subtr.cl:
	moved some method definition frobs into their own file so we don't
	have to compile everything so often

	* clem.asd, clem-test.asd:
	cleaned up asdf file logic a bit. Now there's a piece of code that
	  needs to go in each .asd file, but we don't get screwy behavior
	  based on partial overriding of asdf methods. Now each system gets
	  its own subclass of cl-source-file type and components are specified
	  as :clem-cl-source-file, for instance, instead of :file. Files
	  usually have .cl as the suffix, but this is easily changeable on a
	  per-system basis and fasls go in a separate directory.

	removed unused with-map-range-vals
	added some ignore declarations
	removed gensyms for loop variables when there was no macro body
	moved matrix-scale definitions into their own file
	added more tests

	* src/defmatrix-types.cl:
	finally found the extraneous b and removed it!

	* clem.asd: removed util dependency

	* src/metaclasses.cl, src/matrix.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/defmatrix.cl:
	removed dependency on util. Had to copy some stuff over here to do it, however. Goes against OAOO but means we don't need util to run clem (except for the tests).

	* src/row-vector.cl, src/col-vector.cl:
	remove reference to undefined functions and call make-instance. WARNING: this hasn't been tested, but at least it compiles now!

	  * more tests

2005-05-12  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* clem.asd: bumped version #.

	* src/defmatrix-types.cl:
	added eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel) around the matrix
	definitions so that the function definitions can use the classes to DTRT.

	* clem.asd, src/defmatrix-types.cl, src/defmatrix.cl, src/matrix.cl, src/metaclasses.cl, src/typed-matrix.cl:
	finally! got things back to a working state.
	summary of major changes:
	1. matrix now is a standard-matrix-class
	2. added accessors for standard-matrix-class element type
	   and specialized-array-p or whatever
	3. funky eval-when hacks to get the matrix classes defined before the
	   functions which use the meta-data at function definition time
	   to generate the proper declare statements so that all of this
	   runs quickly.

	* clem-test.asd, clem.asd, src/defmatrix-types.cl, src/defmatrix.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/matrix.cl, src/metaclasses.cl:
	checkpoint so I can use on multiple computers.

	* test/test-clem2.cl, test/test-defmatrix.cl, test/test-gaussian-convolve.cl:
	fixing tests for new regime.

	* test/bench-matrix.cl: getting ready to for metaclass stuff.

2005-04-18  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/matrix.cl, src/matrixops.cl, src/typed-matrix.cl:
	checkpoint now that we cons a lot less than we used to when doing a
	discrete-convolve. We still have a little ways to go, but it's much
	better than before.
