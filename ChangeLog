	* clem.asd, clem-test.asd: more asdf cleanup

	* test/test-mean.cl, test/test-gaussian-convolve.cl, test/test-dilate.cl, test/test-defmatrix.cl, test/test-clem2.cl, test/test-clem.cl, test/mattest4.cl, test/mattest3.cl, test/bench-matrix.cl, src/typed-matrix-utils.cl, src/matrixops.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/defmatrix.cl, src/defmatrix-types.cl, src/defmatrix-scale.cl, src/defmatrix-move-add-subtr.cl, src/defmatrix-hprod.cl, bootstrap.cl:
	* The big unsigned-byte -> ub8 and friends rename.
	  ... Now use ub32-matrix instead of unsigned-long matrix.
	      Some folks might hate the numbers, but word and long were
	      just too vague and all of those unsigned ints are in fact
	      bytes to lisp anyway!

	* test/test-clem3.cl: making function names agree
	removing erroneous compiler output that popped in here somehow

	* src/defmatrix-types.cl, src/defmatrix-move-add-subtr.cl:
	moved some method definition frobs into their own file so we don't
	have to compile everything so often

	* clem.asd, clem-test.asd:
	cleaned up asdf file logic a bit. Now there's a piece of code that
	  needs to go in each .asd file, but we don't get screwy behavior
	  based on partial overriding of asdf methods. Now each system gets
	  its own subclass of cl-source-file type and components are specified
	  as :clem-cl-source-file, for instance, instead of :file. Files
	  usually have .cl as the suffix, but this is easily changeable on a
	  per-system basis and fasls go in a separate directory.

	* test/test-clem3.cl, test/test-clem2.cl, src/defmatrix.cl, src/defmatrix-types.cl, src/defmatrix-scale.cl, src/defmatrix-hprod.cl, clem.asd, TODO:
	Added defmatrix-hprod and defmatrix-scale for matrix scale and hadamard product
	removed unused specialized-type parameter from with-map-range
	removed unused with-map-range-vals
	added some ignore declarations
	removed gensyms for loop variables when there was no macro body
	moved matrix-scale definitions into their own file
	added more tests

	* src/defmatrix-types.cl:
	finally found the extraneous b and removed it!

	Added test-clem3 for messing around
	Added dependencies on defpackage in the asdf file

	* src/defmatrix.cl, src/defmatrix-types.cl:
	added :execute to eval-when forms
	fixed accumulator type of signed-bytes and signed-words
	  ... (unsigned-byte 32) -> (signed-byte 32)
	added def-matrix-scale
	added forms to call def-matrix-scale for the basic types

	* ChangeLog: more ChangeLog stuff.

	* TODO, README, LICENSE:
	Added LICENSE and TODO. Removed TODO stuff from README.

	* clem.asd: removed util dependency

	* src/metaclasses.cl, src/matrix.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/defmatrix.cl:
	removed dependency on util. Had to copy some stuff over here to do it, however. Goes against OAOO but means we don't need util to run clem (except for the tests).

	* src/row-vector.cl, src/col-vector.cl:
	remove reference to undefined functions and call make-instance. WARNING: this hasn't been tested, but at least it compiles now!

2005-06-13  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* test/test-clem2.cl: adding new tests (slowly).

	* src/typed-matrix-utils.cl, src/metaclasses.cl, src/matrix.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/defmatrix.cl, src/defmatrix-types.cl:
	val-format is now a metaclass option rather than a class allocated variable
	... added val-format stuff to metaclass
	added def-move-element and def-matrix-move
	added new matrix conversion/move functions
	... this still needs to be cleaned up!
	added def-matrix-move and supporting macros
	export #:identity-matrix and #:copy-to-bit-matrix
	trying to clean up the copy-to-<matrix-type> stuff

	* src/scalar.cl: use element-type instead of storage-type

	* src/row-vector.cl, src/col-vector.cl:
	Cleanup row-vector and col-vector
	... use element-type instead of storage-type
	... call make-instance instead of xxx-vector functions

2005-06-09  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/matrix.cl:
	  *  cleaned up the scalar-op stuff to use macros instead of eval

	* test/test-clem2.cl, src/metaclasses.cl, src/matrix.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/defmatrix.cl, src/defmatrix-types.cl:
	  * Lots of changes to clem. From here on out, I'll try to do a better
		job of documenting them.
	  * new matrix typed arithmetic functions.
	  * cleaning up the matrix macro system
	  * more tests

2005-05-12  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* clem.asd: bumped version #.

	* src/defmatrix-types.cl:
	added eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel) around the matrix
	definitions so that the function definitions can use the classes to DTRT.

2005-05-07  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* clem.asd, src/defmatrix-types.cl, src/defmatrix.cl, src/matrix.cl, src/metaclasses.cl, src/typed-matrix.cl:
	finally! got things back to a working state.
	summary of major changes:
	1. matrix now is a standard-matrix-class
	2. added accessors for standard-matrix-class element type
	   and specialized-array-p or whatever
	3. funky eval-when hacks to get the matrix classes defined before the
	   functions which use the meta-data at function definition time
	   to generate the proper declare statements so that all of this
	   runs quickly.

	* clem-test.asd, clem.asd, src/defmatrix-types.cl, src/defmatrix.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/matrix.cl, src/metaclasses.cl:
	checkpoint so I can use on multiple computers.

	* test/test-clem2.cl, test/test-defmatrix.cl, test/test-gaussian-convolve.cl:
	fixing tests for new regime.

2005-04-19  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* test/bench-matrix.cl: getting ready to for metaclass stuff.

2005-04-18  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/matrix.cl, src/matrixops.cl, src/typed-matrix.cl:
	checkpoint now that we cons a lot less than we used to when doing a
	discrete-convolve. We still have a little ways to go, but it's much
	better than before.
