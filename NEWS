changes in clem-0.1.11 relative to clem-0.1.10 (and older)

* moved gmarkup docs to .sexp docs
* added errors for incongruent matrices in mat-mult
* added early-matrix.cl and moved some styff that needs to get loaded
  early there, like the matrix class definition and some matrix
  condition types

* made affine-transformations have only a six-parameter
  representation, rather than a canonical six and a degenerate seven
  parameter representation

clem-0.1.5 -- Sun Dec  4 23:42:24 2005

* fixed some fundamental problems with the metaclass stuff so that
  classes now inherit metaclass slots from ancestor classes.
